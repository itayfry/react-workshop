# Web development workshop

This project was created by vite with a react + typescript template
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

## Disclaimer

This project purposefully uses different syntaxes and practices for similar use cases to showcase different approaches - therefore it lacks consistency. Of course in a real project consistency is important so pick the approaches that works best for you and stick with them
